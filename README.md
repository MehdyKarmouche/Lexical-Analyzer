# Lexical-Analyzer
This is a lexical analyzer or a lexer of our language written in Python. The aim of our lexer is to turn the input text file into a token stream.

## Implementation choices
#### Python:
We chose Python because most of the team memebers are used to write code in it. Moreover, Python offers the re module (regular expressions or RegEx) which is very useful for us in this part of the project 

## User Manual:

To run this project you need to have Python installed and write your code in the script.mg file.

To download and install python go to:
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

To run the project:
```
python shell.py
```

The output (token stream) of our program will be seen in the terminal.

If the input file name is `<stdin>` then the user could type the code line by line in the command line (after `magnus >`).
  
If the input file name is other than `<stdin>` then the user needs to write code in a file in the same directory as the file *shell.py*.
